# DoItBefore

I have been coding for a long time, and one thing that I haven't fully gotton rid of is procastination, and writing a good README, that is why I have built the project to help me solve to two problem.

Most times, when I get an idea for a project, I get really excited (even too excited), I forget to create a todo or a README for my project, so with this project, I can create a todo, README, and a deadline for my project, while being able to keep track of the countdown.

## Improvment

There are lots of things that I would like to add and modify if this project, I just want to get it working so I can start using it ASAP, one of the reason that even made me build this project is the ability to make it work offline (which I haven't added yet)

## Todos:

I can't think of things that I want to add currently (as I write this), so I will leave a link that refer to the project todo, so I can also live update it

[like to todos]()
